But in the last decade, just as the world at large is undergoing a digital transformation, cryptocurrencies have caused a monetary revolution by introducing a new idea of the concept of money that requires no intermediary to function. For many, the concept of a digital currency that was seemingly created from nothing having any value at all is a tricky concept to reconcile with previous ideas of money. In this course, Dr. Jonathan Reichental gets you up to speed on the basics of cryptocurrency, from blockchain technology, to how you can buy and sell, what it means to be a crypto miner, and the risks and challenges ahead. If you’re interested in exploring the world of crypto, but are tired of being cornered by acquaintances at social gatherings who really want to explain it to you, check out this course."
